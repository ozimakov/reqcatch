# ReqCatch

Basic Node.JS app allowing to catch POST requests with JSON body. After that we can make a GET request to get latest requests back. 
All caught requests are stored in memory.

Running the server: `npm start`

Running the dev mode (powered by `nodemon`): `npm dev`

Supported environment variables:
 - `PORT` to set HTTP port to listen to (default is `3000`)
